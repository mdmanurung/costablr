# Methodology Validation Experiments

`run_methodology_validation.R` runs deterministic simulation experiments that
evaluate methodological concerns without changing package runtime behavior.
Within each scenario and replicate, every artificial-feature strategy receives
the same simulated data and fit seed. This paired design isolates strategy
differences from Monte Carlo differences in the generated data or bootstrap
stream.

## Hypotheses

1. FDP+ thresholding should avoid all-feature collapse under null data, including
   correlated predictor settings.
2. In signal settings, empirical FDP and TPR should quantify the calibration and
   power tradeoff for each artificial-feature strategy.
3. Knockoff fallback frequency should be observable from captured warnings and
   from the additive provenance now stored on fitted objects.
4. Bundled Python metric fixtures should remain numerically identical to exported
   R metric functions.

## Default Run

```sh
Rscript inst/analysis/run_methodology_validation.R --out /tmp/stablr-methodology
```

Defaults are bounded for local development: 3 replicates, 12 bootstraps per fit,
6 auto-lambda values, the Gaussian family, and
`random_permutation,knockoff_equi` artificial features across six scenarios:

- `null_independent`: low-dimensional independent null predictors.
- `null_correlated`: low-dimensional correlated null predictors.
- `signal_independent`: low-dimensional independent predictors with 5 strong
  signals.
- `signal_correlated`: low-dimensional correlated predictors with 5 signals.
- `null_high_dim`: high-dimensional correlated null predictors.
- `signal_high_dim`: high-dimensional correlated predictors with 5 signals.

Scale up with CLI flags such as `--replicates`, `--n-bootstraps`, `--n-lambda`,
`--workers` (Unix-alike independent-replicate process workers),
`--families gaussian,binomial,multinomial,cox`,
`--artificial-types random_permutation,knockoff,knockoff_equi,knockoff_mvr`,
and `--scenarios`.

The locked release profile cannot be downscaled through CLI overrides. It runs
100 paired Monte Carlo replicates per cell, 1,000 bootstraps, and 30 lambdas for
all four advertised outcome families and all four artificial-feature strategies:

```sh
Rscript inst/analysis/run_methodology_validation.R \
  --profile release --workers 32 --out /tmp/stablr-v0.1.1-methodology
```

Release gates are evaluated separately for every
family/scenario/artificial-strategy cell. Missing, incomplete, skipped, or
errored cells fail. For each global-null cell, the one-sided 95% Wilson upper
bounds for selecting anything and for the replicate-level mean selected
fraction must both be at most 0.10, and no replicate may select at least 90% of
features. For each strong-signal cell, the one-sided 95% upper bound for mean
empirical FDP must be at most 0.12 and the corresponding lower bound for mean
TPR must be at least 0.50.

## Artifacts

All artifacts are written under the user-specified `--out` directory.

- `methodology_validation_replicates.csv`: one row per scenario, replicate, and
  artificial-feature strategy. Columns include the paired data and fit seeds,
  scenario metadata, warning counts, selected-feature counts, true positives,
  false positives, empirical FDP, TPR, FDP+ minimum and threshold,
  real/artificial stability-score summaries, selected feature names, and any
  error text.
- `methodology_validation_summary.csv`: grouped means by scenario and artificial
  type, including SD and Monte Carlo SE for selected-feature count, empirical
  FDP, and TPR; empirical FDP exceedance rate relative to `--target-fdp` with
  its Monte Carlo SE; fallback rates with Monte Carlo SE; and elapsed time.
- `methodology_validation_warnings.csv`: captured warning messages with scenario,
  replicate, artificial type, and warning index. Random-permutation fallback and
  MVR-to-equi fallback rates are derived from this table; fitted objects also
  expose `artificial_provenance` for direct per-fit reporting.
- `python_metrics_parity.csv`: observed R metric values compared against bundled
  Python parity fixtures with absolute error and `ok`/`mismatch` status.
- `methodology_validation_manifest.txt`: run settings, hypotheses, and artifact
  paths.
- `methodology_validation_gates.csv`: per-cell gate bounds, completeness status,
  criteria, and pass/fail results.

## Non-Additions

The runner deliberately does not change FDP+ thresholding or promote any new
artificial-feature strategy to a default. The current fitting rule chooses the
minimum of the diagnostic FDP+ curve. A plotted `fdr_target` is a visual
reference only: it is not used by fitting and is not a universal false-discovery
guarantee. Methodological changes should be evaluated with these artifacts
before they are added to package runtime paths.
