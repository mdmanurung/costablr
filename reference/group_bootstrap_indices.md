# Group-Aware Bootstrap Sampler Indices

Draws row indices for a single STABL bootstrap iteration by sampling
**groups** rather than individual samples. Use this instead of
`classic_bootstrap_indices()` whenever the training data contains
repeated measurements or known clusters (e.g. multiple time-points per
subject, technical replicates, or family members).

## Usage

``` r
group_bootstrap_indices(
  y,
  groups,
  n_subsamples,
  replace = FALSE,
  stratify = FALSE,
  strata = NULL,
  seed = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

  - y:
    
    Outcome vector with the same length as `groups`.

  - groups:
    
    Vector of group identifiers (same length as `y`). Values may be any
    type that supports `unique()` and equality comparison.

  - n\_subsamples:
    
    Positive integer; target number of rows in the subsample. The actual
    count may differ slightly due to whole-group granularity (whole
    groups are always preserved; the realised count is the smallest
    group-aligned value `>= n_subsamples`).

  - replace:
    
    Logical; may the same group be sampled more than once? Default
    `FALSE`.

  - stratify:
    
    Logical; if `TRUE`, sample whole groups within outcome strata so the
    realised subsample retains class representation where the group
    structure permits it. Each group must map to exactly one outcome
    class. Whole groups are still preserved, so realised counts can
    exceed per-class targets. Default `FALSE`.

  - strata:
    
    Optional categorical stratification design. Provide a vector for one
    stratification factor, or a `data.frame`/matrix/list for a joint
    design across multiple factors. Each group must map to exactly one
    realised stratum.

  - seed:
    
    Optional integer; passed to `set.seed()` before sampling. `NULL`
    leaves the RNG state unchanged.

## Value

Integer vector of 1-based row indices into the training set.

## Details

**Why group-level sampling prevents leakage:** If individual rows from
the same subject appear in both the bootstrap subsample and its
complement, the stability score becomes inflated because the learner can
partially memorise subject-level patterns. By sampling complete groups,
the subsample and its "holdout" are subject-disjoint, preserving the
independence assumption underlying STABL's FDP+ guarantee.

**How groups are sampled:** Groups are drawn one at a time (without
replacement by default) until the running tally of included rows reaches
or exceeds `n_subsamples`. Whole groups are always kept intact: if the
last added group causes the count to exceed `n_subsamples`, the surplus
rows are *not* trimmed. This guarantees the strongest leakage prevention
(the subsample and its complement are always group-disjoint), at the
cost of a slightly variable subsample size. When `replace = TRUE` the
same group may be drawn multiple times (useful when there are very few
groups).

**Degenerate bootstrap guard:** As with `classic_bootstrap_indices()`,
if the final subsample contains only one unique class the function
retries until a class-diverse sample is obtained.

## See also

`classic_bootstrap_indices()` for independent-sample data, `stabl_fit()`
which calls this sampler automatically when `groups` is supplied.

## Examples

``` r
# 3 groups with 4 samples each; binary outcome
y      <- c(0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1)
groups <- rep(c("G1", "G2", "G3"), each = 4L)
idx    <- group_bootstrap_indices(y, groups, n_subsamples = 8L, seed = 1L)
table(groups[idx])  # whole groups only; count >= 8
```
