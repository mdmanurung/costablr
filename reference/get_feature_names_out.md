# Get the Names of Selected Features from a Fitted STABL Object

Convenience wrapper around `get_support()` that returns only the names
of the features that pass the stability threshold, ready for use as
column selectors in downstream modelling (e.g. `x[,
get_feature_names_out(fit)]`).

## Usage

``` r
get_feature_names_out(object, new_hard_threshold = NULL)
```

## Arguments

  - object:
    
    A fitted `"stabl_fit"` object returned by `stabl_fit()`.

  - new\_hard\_threshold:
    
    Numeric in `(0, 1]` or `NULL`. Forwarded to `get_support()`; see
    that function for the full threshold resolution order.

## Value

Character vector of selected feature names. An empty character vector is
returned when no feature passes the threshold (and `explore = FALSE` was
used during fitting).

## See also

`get_support()` for the binary mask, `get_importances()` for ranked
scores.

## Examples

``` r
set.seed(1L)
x <- matrix(rnorm(30 * 5), 30, 5,
            dimnames = list(paste0("s", 1:30), paste0("f", 1:5)))
y <- setNames(rnorm(30), rownames(x))
fit <- stabl_fit(x, y,
                 lambda_grid    = data.frame(lambda = c(0.2, 0.1, 0.05)),
                 n_bootstraps   = 4L,
                 hard_threshold = 0.3,
                 random_state   = 1L)
sel <- get_feature_names_out(fit)   # character vector
x_sel <- x[, sel, drop = FALSE]    # subset to selected columns
```
