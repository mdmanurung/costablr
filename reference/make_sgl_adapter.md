# Build a Sparse Group Lasso Learner Adapter

Returns a closure that fits `sparsegl::sparsegl()` on a single bootstrap
subsample and returns a logical selection mask over the features.

## Usage

``` r
make_sgl_adapter(
  family = "gaussian",
  feature_groups,
  alpha_fixed = NULL,
  bootstrap_threshold = .BOOTSTRAP_COEF_THRESHOLD
)
```

## Arguments

  - family:
    
    Character; response family (`"gaussian"`, `"binomial"`, or
    `"multinomial"`). Cox regression is not supported by `sparsegl`.

  - feature\_groups:
    
    Integer or factor vector of length `p` (number of features)
    assigning each feature to a group. Values are coerced via
    `as.integer(as.factor(...))`, so any type that has a natural
    ordering is accepted.

  - alpha\_fixed:
    
    Numeric scalar in `[0, 1]` or `NULL`. When not `NULL`, overrides any
    `alpha` column in `lambda_val`. Controls the lasso / group-lasso
    mixing weight (`asparse` in `sparsegl`).

  - bootstrap\_threshold:
    
    Positive numeric; absolute-coefficient cutoff used to decide that a
    feature is selected in a given bootstrap.

## Value

A function with signature `function(x, y, lambda_val) -> logical vector
of length ncol(x)`.

## Details

Sparse-group lasso is useful when features have a known (or inferred)
block structure, for example gene pathways, omic layers, or correlated
feature clusters. It imposes simultaneous sparsity within and between
groups: the group-level penalty encourages whole groups to be zeroed
out, while the within-group lasso penalty allows groups to have only a
sparse subset of active features. This can substantially improve
stability in structured high-dimensional settings.

The `alpha` value (`asparse` in `sparsegl`) controls the balance between
the within-group lasso penalty and the group-level penalty: 0 = pure
group lasso; 1 = pure lasso (no group penalty). The default of `0.05`
used when no `alpha` column is present matches the Python STABL
reference.

This adapter factory is primarily an internal backend used by
`stabl_fit()`. For end-to-end feature selection workflows, prefer
`base_learner = "sparse_group_lasso"` in `stabl_fit()` and provide
`feature_groups` (or `corr_group_threshold`) there.

## Examples

``` r
if (requireNamespace("sparsegl", quietly = TRUE)) {
  set.seed(3L)
  x <- matrix(rnorm(200L), 20L, 10L)
  y <- rnorm(20L)
  groups  <- rep(1:5, each = 2L)
  adapter <- make_sgl_adapter(family = "gaussian", feature_groups = groups)
  mask <- adapter(x, y, data.frame(lambda = 0.1))
  cat("selected:", sum(mask), "of", ncol(x), "features\n")
}
```
