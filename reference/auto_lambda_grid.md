# Build a Data-Driven Lambda Grid

Runs `glmnet` on the full training data to obtain a calibrated penalty
sequence, returning the result as a pre-expanded `data.frame` suitable
for use as the `lambda_grid` argument of `stabl_fit()`.

## Usage

``` r
auto_lambda_grid(x, y, family = "gaussian", n_lambda = 30L, l1_ratio = NULL)
```

## Arguments

  - x:
    
    Numeric matrix of predictors (samples by features).

  - y:
    
    Outcome vector. For `"gaussian"` provide a numeric vector; for
    `"binomial"`/`"multinomial"` provide a factor or 0/1 integer vector;
    for `"cox"` provide a `survival::Surv` object.

  - family:
    
    Character; `glmnet` response family (`"gaussian"`, `"binomial"`,
    `"multinomial"`, or `"cox"`). Default `"gaussian"`.

  - n\_lambda:
    
    Positive integer; desired number of lambda values per alpha level.
    Actual length may be slightly shorter if `glmnet` detects saturation
    early. Default `30L`.

  - l1\_ratio:
    
    Numeric scalar, numeric vector, or `NULL`. When `NULL` (default), a
    pure lasso path (alpha = 1) is used. When a vector is supplied (e.g.
    `c(0.5, 0.75, 1.0)`), one path is fitted per value and the results
    are combined; an `alpha` column is added to the output.

## Value

A `data.frame` with at least a `lambda` column. An `alpha` column is
included whenever `l1_ratio` is not `NULL`.

## Details

Choosing lambda values manually is error-prone: too large a lambda
selects nothing; too small a lambda selects everything. This function
delegates the sequence computation to `glmnet`'s own warm-start path
algorithm, which guarantees the grid spans from near-zero sparsity to
near-full sparsity for the given data, family, and alpha.

For elastic-net models, supplying a vector of `l1_ratio` values causes
the function to fit a separate path per alpha, row-bind the resulting
grids, and add an `alpha` column so that `make_glmnet_adapter()` can
dispatch correctly. This mirrors `auto_mode_lambda_grid()` in the Python
reference implementation.

## See also

`stabl_fit()` which calls this automatically when `lambda_grid =
"auto"`.

## Examples

``` r
set.seed(1L)
x <- matrix(rnorm(40 * 6), 40, 6,
             dimnames = list(paste0("s", 1:40), paste0("f", 1:6)))
y <- setNames(rnorm(40), rownames(x))
grid <- auto_lambda_grid(x, y, family = "gaussian", n_lambda = 10L)
head(grid)
```
