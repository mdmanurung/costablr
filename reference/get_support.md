# Get the Feature Selection Mask from a Fitted STABL Object

Returns a named logical vector that is `TRUE` for every feature whose
maximum stability score exceeds the effective threshold. This is the
primary accessor for downstream use of a fitted STABL model: index your
data matrix with the returned mask, or pass the object to
`get_feature_names_out()` to obtain the names directly.

## Usage

``` r
get_support(object, new_hard_threshold = NULL)
```

## Arguments

  - object:
    
    A fitted `"stabl_fit"` object returned by `stabl_fit()`.

  - new\_hard\_threshold:
    
    Numeric in `(0, 1]` or `NULL`. When supplied, overrides the
    threshold stored in `object` for this call only.

## Value

Named logical vector of length `object$n_features_in_`. Names are the
original feature names from the training matrix.

## Details

**Threshold resolution order:**

1.  `new_hard_threshold` (if supplied to this call).

2.  `object$hard_threshold` (if a hard threshold was given to
    `stabl_fit()`).

3.  `object$fdr_min_threshold_` (the FDP+-optimal threshold computed
    from artificial features during fitting).

An error is raised when none of these is available — which can only
happen if `stabl_fit()` was called with both `artificial_type = NULL`
and no `hard_threshold`.

**Explore fallback:** When `explore = TRUE` was set during fitting and
no feature's score exceeds the threshold, the function returns the top
`n_explore` features instead of an all-`FALSE` vector. This is useful in
exploratory analyses where you want at least some candidates even when
the signal is weak.

`get_feature_names_out()` to get names directly, `get_importances()` to
inspect raw stability scores.

## Examples

``` r
set.seed(1L)
x <- matrix(rnorm(30 * 5), 30, 5,
            dimnames = list(paste0("s", 1:30), paste0("f", 1:5)))
y <- setNames(rnorm(30), rownames(x))
fit <- stabl_fit(x, y,
                 lambda_grid    = data.frame(lambda = c(0.2, 0.1, 0.05)),
                 n_bootstraps   = 4L,
                 hard_threshold = 0.3,
                 random_state   = 1L)
get_support(fit)                        # named logical vector
get_support(fit, new_hard_threshold = 0.5)  # stricter threshold
```
