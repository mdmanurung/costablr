# Plot a ROC Curve

Generates a ggplot2 ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve from
binary outcome labels and predicted probabilities, together with the
chance-level diagonal for reference.

## Usage

``` r
plot_roc(y_true, y_preds, title = "ROC Curve")
```

## Arguments

  - y\_true:
    
    Integer or logical vector of binary outcomes (1/`TRUE` for the
    positive class, 0/`FALSE` for the negative class). Must be the same
    length as `y_preds`.

  - y\_preds:
    
    Numeric vector of predicted probabilities for the positive class.
    Values must be in \\(\[0, 1\]\\) for interpretable results.

  - title:
    
    Character scalar; plot title. Default `"ROC Curve"`.

## Value

A `ggplot` object. The AUC is shown as a caption.

## Details

ROC curves visualise the trade-off between sensitivity (TPR) and
specificity (1 - FPR) across all possible classification thresholds. Use
this plot to assess overall discriminative ability after applying STABL
feature selection and fitting a downstream classifier on the selected
features. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is shown in the caption.

## See also

`plot_prc()` for precision-recall curves (preferred when classes are
severely imbalanced).

## Examples

``` r
if (requireNamespace("ggplot2", quietly = TRUE)) {
  set.seed(1L)
  y_true  <- sample(0:1, 50, replace = TRUE)
  y_preds <- pmin(pmax(y_true * 0.6 + rnorm(50, 0, 0.3), 0), 1)
  plot_roc(y_true, y_preds)
}
```
