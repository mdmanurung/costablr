# Vendored from CRAN multiview v1.0 (GPL-2). See inst/COPYING.cooperative.

# Perform cooperative learning using the direct algorithm for
# two or more views.
#
# `multiview` uses [glmnet::glmnet()] to do most of its work and
# therefore takes many of the same parameters, but an intercept is
# always included and several other parameters do not
# apply. Such inapplicable arguments are overridden and warnings issued.
# 
# The current code can be slow for "large" data sets, e.g. when the
# number of features is larger than 1000.  It can be helpful to see
# the progress of multiview as it runs; to do this, set trace.it = 1
# in the call to multiview or cv.multiview.  With this, multiview
# prints out its progress along the way.  One can also pre-filter the
# features to a smaller set, using the exclude option, with a filter
# function.
# 
# If there are missing values in the feature matrices: we recommend
# that you center the columns of each feature matrix, and then fill
# in the missing values with 0.
# 
# For example, \cr
# `x <- scale(x,TRUE,FALSE)` \cr
# `x[is.na(x)] <- 0` \cr
# `z <- scale(z,TRUE,FALSE)` \cr
# `z[is.na(z)] <- 0` \cr
# 
# Then run multiview in the usual way. It will exploit the assumed shared latent factors
# to make efficient use of the available data.
#
# @param x_list a list of `x` matrices with same number of rows
#   `nobs`
# @param y the quantitative response with length equal to `nobs`, the
#   (same) number of rows in each `x` matrix
# @param rho the weight on the agreement penalty, default 0. `rho=0`
#   is a form of early fusion, and `rho=1` is a form of late fusion.
#   We recommend trying a few values of `rho` including 0, 0.1, 0.25,
#   0.5, and 1 first; sometimes `rho` larger than 1 can also be
#   helpful.
# @param family A description of the error distribution and link
#   function to be used in the model. This is the result of a call to
#   a family function. Default is [stats::gaussian]. (See
#   [stats::family] for details on family functions.)
# @param weights observation weights. Can be total counts if
#   responses are proportion matrices. Default is 1 for each
#   observation
# @param offset A vector of length \code{nobs} that is included in
#   the linear predictor (a \code{nobs x nc} matrix for the
#   \code{"multinomial"} family).  Useful for the \code{"poisson"}
#   family (e.g. log of exposure time), or for refining a model by
#   starting at a current fit. Default is \code{NULL}. If supplied,
#   then values must also be supplied to the \code{predict} function.
# @param alpha The elasticnet mixing parameter, with
#   \eqn{0\le\alpha\le 1}.  The penalty is defined as
#   \deqn{(1-\alpha)/2||\beta||_2^2+\alpha||\beta||_1.}
#   \code{alpha=1} is the lasso penalty, and \code{alpha=0} the ridge
#   penalty.
# @param nlambda The number of \code{lambda} values - default is 100.
# @param lambda.min.ratio Smallest value for \code{lambda}, as a
#   fraction of \code{lambda.max}, the (data derived) entry value
#   (i.e. the smallest value for which all coefficients are
#   zero). The default depends on the sample size \code{nobs}
#   relative to the number of variables \code{nvars}. If \code{nobs >
#   nvars}, the default is \code{0.0001}, close to zero.  If
#   \code{nobs < nvars}, the default is \code{0.01}.  A very small
#   value of \code{lambda.min.ratio} will lead to a saturated fit in
#   the \code{nobs < nvars} case. This is undefined for
#   \code{"binomial"} and \code{"multinomial"} models, and
#   \code{glmnet} will exit gracefully when the percentage deviance
#   explained is almost 1.
# @param lambda A user supplied \code{lambda} sequence. Typical usage
#   is to have the program compute its own \code{lambda} sequence
#   based on \code{nlambda} and \code{lambda.min.ratio}. Supplying a
#   value of \code{lambda} overrides this. WARNING: use with
#   care. Avoid supplying a single value for \code{lambda} (for
#   predictions after CV use \code{predict()} instead).  Supply
#   instead a decreasing sequence of \code{lambda}
#   values. \code{glmnet} relies on its warms starts for speed, and
#   its often faster to fit a whole path than compute a single fit.
# @param standardize Logical flag for x variable standardization,
#   prior to fitting the model sequence. The coefficients are always
#   returned on the original scale. Default is
#   \code{standardize=TRUE}.  If variables are in the same units
#   already, you might not wish to standardize. See details below for
#   y standardization with \code{family="gaussian"}.
# @param intercept Should intercept(s) be fitted (default `TRUE`)
# @param thresh Convergence threshold for coordinate descent. Each
#   inner coordinate-descent loop continues until the maximum change
#   in the objective after any coefficient update is less than
#   \code{thresh} times the null deviance. Defaults value is
#   \code{1E-7}.
# @param penalty.factor Separate penalty factors can be applied to
#   each coefficient. This is a number that multiplies \code{lambda}
#   to allow differential shrinkage. Can be 0 for some variables,
#   which implies no shrinkage, and that variable is always included
#   in the model. Default is 1 for all variables (and implicitly
#   infinity for variables listed in \code{exclude}). Note: the
#   penalty factors are internally rescaled to sum to nvars, and the
#   lambda sequence will reflect this change.
# @param lower.limits Vector of lower limits for each coefficient;
#   default \code{-Inf}. Each of these must be non-positive. Can be
#   presented as a single value (which will then be replicated), else
#   a vector of length \code{nvars}
# @param upper.limits Vector of upper limits for each coefficient;
#   default \code{Inf}. See \code{lower.limits}
# @param maxit Maximum number of passes over the data for all lambda
#   values; default is 10^5.
# @param exclude Indices of variables to be excluded from the
#   model. Default is none. Equivalent to an infinite penalty factor
#   for the variables excluded (next item).  Users can supply instead
#   an `exclude` function that generates the list of indices.  This
#   function is most generally defined as `function(x_list, y, ...)`,
#   and is called inside `multiview` to generate the indices for
#   excluded variables.  The `...` argument is required, the others
#   are optional.  This is useful for filtering wide data, and works
#   correctly with `cv.multiview`. See the vignette 'Introduction'
#   for examples.
# @param lambda A user supplied `lambda` sequence, default
#   `NULL`. Typical usage is to have the program compute its own
#   `lambda` sequence. This sequence, in general, is different from
#   that used in the [glmnet::glmnet()] call (named `lambda`)
#   Supplying a value of `lambda` overrides this. WARNING: use with
#   care. Avoid supplying a single value for `lambda` (for
#   predictions after CV use [stats::predict()] instead.  Supply
#   instead a decreasing sequence of `lambda` values as `multiview`
#   relies on its warms starts for speed, and its often faster to fit
#   a whole path than compute a single fit.
# @param trace.it If \code{trace.it=1}, then a progress bar is
#   displayed; useful for big models that take a long time to fit.
# @return An object with S3 class `"multiview","*" `, where `"*"` is
#   `"elnet"`, `"lognet"`, `"multnet"`, `"fishnet"` (poisson),
#   `"coxnet"` or `"mrelnet"` for the various types of models.
