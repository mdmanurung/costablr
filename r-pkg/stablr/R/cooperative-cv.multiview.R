# Perform k-fold cross-validation for cooperative learning
#
# Does k-fold cross-validation (CV) for multiview and produces a CV curve.
# 
# The current code can be slow for "large" data sets, e.g. when the
# number of features is larger than 1000.  It can be helpful to see
# the progress of multiview as it runs; to do this, set trace.it = 1
# in the call to multiview or cv.multiview.  With this, multiview
# prints out its progress along the way.  One can also pre-filter the
# features to a smaller set, using the exclude option, with a filter
# function.
# 
# If there are missing values in the feature matrices: 
# we recommend that you center the columns of each feature matrix, and then fill in the missing values with 0.
# 
# For example, \cr
# `x <- scale(x,TRUE,FALSE)` \cr
# `x[is.na(x)] <- 0` \cr
# `z <- scale(z,TRUE,FALSE)` \cr
# `z[is.na(z)] <- 0` \cr
# 
# Then run multiview in the usual way. It will exploit the assumed shared latent factors
# to make efficient use of the available data.
#
# The function runs `multiview` `nfolds+1` times; the first to get the
# `lambda` sequence, and then the remainder to compute the fit with each
# of the folds omitted. The error is accumulated, and the average error and
# standard deviation over the folds is computed.  Note that `cv.multiview`
# does NOT search for values for `rho`. A specific value should be
# supplied, else `rho=0` is assumed by default. If users would like to
# cross-validate `rho` as well, they should call `cv.multiview` with
# a pre-computed vector `foldid`, and then use this same fold vector in
# separate calls to `cv.multiview` with different values of `rho`.
#

# @param weights Observation weights; defaults to 1 per observation
# @param offset Offset vector (matrix) as in `multiview`
# @param type.measure loss to use for cross-validation. Currently
#   five options, not all available for all models. The default is
#   `type.measure="deviance"`, which uses squared-error for gaussian
#   models (a.k.a `type.measure="mse"` there), deviance for logistic
#   and poisson regression, and partial-likelihood for the Cox model.
#   `type.measure="class"` applies to binomial and multinomial
#   logistic regression only, and gives misclassification error.
#   `type.measure="auc"` is for two-class logistic regression only,
#   and gives area under the ROC curve. `type.measure="mse"` or
#   `type.measure="mae"` (mean absolute error) can be used by all
#   models except the `"cox"`; they measure the deviation from the
#   fitted mean to the response.  `type.measure="C"` is Harrel's
#   concordance measure, only available for `cox` models.
# @param nfolds number of folds - default is 10. Although `nfolds`
#   can be as large as the sample size (leave-one-out CV), it is not
#   recommended for large datasets. Smallest value allowable is
#   `nfolds=3`
# @param foldid an optional vector of values between 1 and `nfold`
#   identifying what fold each observation is in. If supplied,
#   `nfold` can be missing.
# @param lambda A user supplied `lambda` sequence, default
#   `NULL`. Typical usage is to have the program compute its own
#   `lambda` sequence. This sequence, in general, is different from
#   that used in the [glmnet::glmnet()] call (named `lambda`). Note
#   that this is done for the full model (master sequence), and
#   separately for each fold.  The fits are then aligned using the
#   glmnet lambda sequence associated with the master sequence (see
#   the `alignment` argument for additional details). Adapting
#   `lambda` for each fold leads to better convergence. When
#   `lambda` is supplied, the same sequence is used everywhere, but
#   in some GLMs can lead to convergence issues.
# @param alignment This is an experimental argument, designed to fix
#   the problems users were having with CV, with possible values
#   `"lambda"` (the default) else `"fraction"`. With `"lambda"` the
#   `lambda` values from the master fit (on all the data) are used to
#   line up the predictions from each of the folds. In some cases
#   this can give strange values, since the effective `lambda` values
#   in each fold could be quite different. With `"fraction"` we line
#   up the predictions in each fold according to the fraction of
#   progress along the regularization. If in the call a `lambda`
#   argument is also provided, `alignment="fraction"` is ignored
#   (with a warning).
# @param grouped This is an experimental argument, with default
#   `TRUE`, and can be ignored by most users. For all models except
#   the `"cox"`, this refers to computing `nfolds` separate
#   statistics, and then using their mean and estimated standard
#   error to describe the CV curve. If `grouped=FALSE`, an error
#   matrix is built up at the observation level from the predictions
#   from the `nfold` fits, and then summarized (does not apply to
#   `type.measure="auc"`). For the `"cox"` family, `grouped=TRUE`
#   obtains the CV partial likelihood for the Kth fold by
#   \emph{subtraction}; by subtracting the log partial likelihood
#   evaluated on the full dataset from that evaluated on the on the
#   (K-1)/K dataset. This makes more efficient use of risk sets. With
#   `grouped=FALSE` the log partial likelihood is computed only on
#   the Kth fold
# @param keep If `keep=TRUE`, a \emph{prevalidated} array is returned
#   containing fitted values for each observation and each value of
#   `lambda`. This means these fits are computed with this
#   observation and the rest of its fold omitted. The `foldid` vector
#   is also returned.  Default is keep=FALSE.
# @param trace.it If `trace.it=1`, then progress bars are displayed;
#   useful for big models that take a long time to fit.
# @param \dots Other arguments that can be passed to `multiview`
# @return an object of class `"cv.multiview"` is returned, which is a
#   list with the ingredients of the cross-validation
#   fit. \item{lambda}{the values of `lambda` used in the fits.}
#   \item{cvm}{The mean cross-validated error - a vector of length
#   `length(lambda)`.} \item{cvsd}{estimate of standard error of
#   `cvm`.} \item{cvup}{upper curve = `cvm+cvsd`.} \item{cvlo}{lower
#   curve = `cvm-cvsd`.} \item{nzero}{number of non-zero coefficients
#   at each `lambda`.} \item{name}{a text string indicating type of
#   measure (for plotting purposes).} \item{multiview.fit}{a fitted
#   multiview object for the full data.} \item{lambda.min}{value of
#   `lambda` that gives minimum `cvm`.} \item{lambda.1se}{largest
#   value of `lambda` such that error is within 1 standard error of
#   the minimum.} \item{fit.preval}{if `keep=TRUE`, this is the array
#   of prevalidated fits. Some entries can be `NA`, if that and
#   subsequent values of `lambda` are not reached for that fold}
#   \item{foldid}{if `keep=TRUE`, the fold assignments used}
#   \item{index}{a one column matrix with the indices of `lambda.min`
