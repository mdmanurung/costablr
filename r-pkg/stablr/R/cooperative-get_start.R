# Get null deviance, starting mu and lambda max
#
# Return the null deviance, starting mu and lambda max values for
# initialization. For internal use only.
#
# This function is called by \code{glmnet.path} for null deviance, starting mu
# and lambda max values. It is also called by \code{glmnet.fit} when used
# without warmstart, but they only use the null deviance and starting mu values.
#
# When \code{x} is not sparse, it is expected to already by centered and scaled.
# When \code{x} is sparse, the function will get its attributes \code{xm} and
# \code{xs} for its centering and scaling factors.
#
# Note that whether \code{x} is centered & scaled or not, the values of \code{mu}
# and \code{nulldev} don't change. However, the value of \code{lambda_max} does
# change, and we need \code{xm} and \code{xs} to get the correct value.
#
# @param x Input matrix, of dimension \code{nobs x nvars}; each row is an
# observation vector. If it is a sparse matrix, it is assumed to be unstandardized.
# It should have attributes \code{xm} and \code{xs}, where \code{xm(j)} and
# \code{xs(j)} are the centering and scaling factors for variable j respsectively.
# If it is not a sparse matrix, it is assumed to be standardized.
# @param y Quantitative response variable.
# @param weights Observation weights.
# @param family A description of the error distribution and link function to be
# used in the model. This is the result of a call to a family function.
# (See \code{\link[stats:family]{family}} for details on family functions.)
# @param intercept Does the model we are fitting have an intercept term or not?
# @param is.offset Is the model being fit with an offset or not?
# @param offset Offset for the model. If \code{is.offset=FALSE}, this should be
# a zero vector of the same length as \code{y}.
# @param exclude Indices of variables to be excluded from the model.
# @param vp Separate penalty factors can be applied to each coefficient.
# @param alpha The elasticnet mixing parameter, with \eqn{0 \le \alpha \le 1}.
